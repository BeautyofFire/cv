  <h2>Were you wondering what a chic sophisticated man like myself enjoys?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm what they would call a proud 'Daddy's boy'! I prefer to call him Papa. Wherever he goes, I go! Unless I'm napping of course. He's always there when I wake up. I'll walk around yelling for him so he knows I'm awake to play.</li>
    <br>
    <li>I love catching some sun. You can do everything from watching birds to napping in it!</li>
    <br>
    <li>To all my fellow North East felines you'll get this -- Leaves!! This is my favorite part of where my Papa and Lady live.</li>
    <br>
    <li>If I'm being held and cuddled I love kisses on the top of my head. I always purr when it happens. </li>
    <br>
    <li>I have a favorite blanket, it's super soft and cuddly. It's one of my top 4 napping spots. The lady crochet it for me, it matches my Papas.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Berber carpet - that's when being bad never felt so good! When I met my Papa and Lady they introduced me to it.<br />
      A few months before I was adopted my people put it in for me. I loved digging my claws into it and pulling up all the fibers - it's purfect! Papa made scratchers for me out of it. It's not as good as the real thing.</li>
    <br>
    <li>I'm what they call a bit of a foodie. If someone is eating a Potato chip near me, I'm there. Bonus points if they're Pringles sour cream and onion. They're my <strong>favorite!</strong></li>
    <br>
    <li>At night I like to sleep with my people in their bed. It makes it easy to wake up early and get an extra snuggle in with my people. </li>
    <br>
    <li>I love sight-seeing!! Any of the windows in my home always has something happening in it. There's always birds, leaves or something interesting to watch. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Have you seen what you can do with cardboard boxes? The big ones are extra fun. I love to hide and peek out of them! My papa also puts his shirts in them for me to nest in.</li>
    <br>
    <li>After every dinner Papa and I have a special routiene. I insist on sitting on his chest as I burp and digest my food. I'll purr and get so comfortable I'll sometimes fall asleep.</li>
  </ul>
